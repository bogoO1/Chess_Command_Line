# Chess_Command_Line

This is a project for The Odin Project which involves creating a fully functional CLI chess game in Ruby. I have decided to write it in a way that the game gets input from the user in CLI format, but displays the game in a GUI.


This is my first real Github project, so please be understanding with some conventions I may not follow.
